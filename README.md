## Description

command-line tool that lets you download media from OnlyFans and perform bulk actions including liking or unliking posts.

![CopyQ nsUBdI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67020411/227816586-fb685959-cd3f-45af-adea-14773b7154f9.png)

At its inception, this project emerged as a fork of the original onlyfans-scraper. With invaluable support from the community and consistent script updates, we've undergone substantial architectural changes, resulting in a significantly revamped codebase compared to the original master. While some of these modifications are detailed [HERE](https://github.com/datawhores/OF-Scraper/blob/main/CHANGES.md), most are only documented in the commit history.

This script has been thoughtfully crafted to facilitate seamless transitions from DIGITALCRIMINALS' script, ensuring robust compatibility and smooth feature migration. Furthermore, it boasts an extensive array of filtering features, empowering users with precise control over the specific content types they aim to scrape
